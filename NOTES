Updated to Hunchentoot 1.0:
---------------------------
- JSON methods must (format nil ...)
- use ENCODE-JSON-ALIST-TO-STRING rather than ENCODE-JSON-ALIST
- *might* be able to deprecate cookie id, if sessions work with AJAX calls.

TO DO:
- query by date
- additional financial statements
- change class names back to <> notation (Only for non-db classes.)
- trap RETURN key like mood genie js
